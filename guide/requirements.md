Does the implementation effectively utilize the venn-custom-detection api and its built-in capabilities?
Are comments included to clarify the logic and purpose of the code?
Is the code structured in a readable and organized manner?
Testing

Do all test cases execute correctly and pass without issues?
Are there test cases designed to confirm that triggers are not generated in incorrect scenarios?
Are there test cases that verify are triggered when expected?
Documentation

Does the README.md clearly explain what the custom detector does?
Are the triggers descriptions in README.md well-structured and easy to understand?
(If relevant) Does the README.md provide real-world block or transaction examples that would trigger the detector?
